# Condition

## if .. else statement

```{r if else, eval = FALSE}
# Structure
if (cond1=true) { 
  cmd1 
} else { 
  cmd2 
}

# Example
x <- 5
if (x > 0) {
  print("positive")
} else {
  print("negative")
}

# More conditions!!
x <- 0
if (x > 0) {
   print("positive")
} else if (x < 0) {
   print("negative")
} else {
   print("zero")
}
```

![tips](images/tip.png) Nesting several conditions can quickly make your code hard to read and debug. Try to avoid complex and multiple nested conditions.

# Loops - Repeating the same operation

# For

```{r for loops, eval = FALSE}
# Structure
for (variable in sequence) { 
    statements
}

for (x in 1:10) { 
    print(x)
}
```

Note:  The `break` function is used to break out of loops, and `next` halts the processing of the current iteration and advances the looping index.

**Challenge**: write a script that sequentially print to the screen the squared value of the following sequence, but exit the loop if the value is larger than 140.

Here is the code to generate the sequence:
```{r for loops challenge, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
s <- rnorm(1:100, mean = 100, sd = 20)
```

# While
```{r while loops, eval = FALSE}
# Structure
while (condition) {
    statements
}

i <- 0
while (i < 10) {
  print(i)
  i = i + 1 # Do not forget to update your condidion
}

```

**Challenge**: redo the challenge using a while loop!


# Learning the apply family of functions

As we discuss previously R is built to work with vectors. The family of `apply` functions has been build to leverage vectorized operations that lower the explicit need of `for` loops. Note that apply functions are in fact C for loops (faster).

These include:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
apply
lapply
tapply
sapply
```

## apply

`apply` applies a function to each row or column of a matrix.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
m <- matrix(c(1:10, 11:20), nrow = 10, ncol = 2)
m
# 1 is the row index
# 2 is the column index
apply(m, 1, sum)
apply(m, 2, sum)
apply(m, 1, mean)
apply(m, 2, mean)
```


## tapply

`tapply` applies a function to subsets of a vector.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
df <- data.frame(names = sample(c("A","B","C"), 10, rep = T), length = rnorm(10))
df
tapply(df$length, df$names, mean)
```

Now with a more familiar dataset.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
tapply(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
```

## lapply (and llply)

What it does: Returns a list of same length as the input. 
Each element of the output is a result of applying a function to the corresponding element.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
my_list <- list(a = 1:10, b = 2:20)
my_list
l <- lapply(my_list, mean)
l
class(l)
```


## sapply

`sapply` is a more user friendly version of `lapply` and will return a list of matrix where appropriate.

Let's work with the same list we just created.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
my_list
x <- sapply(my_list, mean)
x
class(x)
```

## replicate

An extremely useful function to generate datasets for simulation purposes. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
replicate(10, rnorm(10))
replicate(10, rnorm(10), simplify = TRUE)
```

The final arguments turns the result into a vector or matrix if possible.

## mapply
Its more or less a multivariate version of `sapply`. It applies a function to all corresponding elements of each argument. 

Example:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
list_1 <- list(a = c(1:10), b = c(11:20))
list_1
list_2 <- list(c = c(21:30), d = c(31:40))
list_2
mapply(sum, list_1$a, list_1$b, list_2$c, list_2$d)
```
