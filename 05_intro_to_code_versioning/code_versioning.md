# Code versioning - Git

## Why do I need that again?
To **keep track of changes you made to your scripts**. Code versiong allows to choose when you reached a stage in your code that you think is worth keep trace of, like a new function that makes your data analysis soooooo much better.

## What git is
- Git is a line based version control for ascii files (any file you can read with a texteditor). Meaning it will track any changes in a line of the ascii file.
- Git stores snapshot of your files (that have changes) 
- Git is distributed, meaning that all the copies of your repository are of equal value, containing all your codes and its history. There no central repository
- Git has integrity, meaning each file is check to be sure there was not loss during any file transfer

## What git is not
- Git is not a backup
- Git is not GitHub (or more accuralty the opposit way: GitHub is not Git)
- it is not meant to store large data (by default)


## The Git workflow

1. You modify files in your working directory and save them as usual

2. You **add** snapshots of your changes files to your staging area.

3. You do a **commit**, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshots permanently to your Git directory.

And repeat!!

You can do a parallel with taking a family picture: 

1. Everybody puts its latest outfit on
2. You select the persons you would like to add to the picture and  place them on your stage/scene and take the picture
3. You store your latest picture in your photobook
