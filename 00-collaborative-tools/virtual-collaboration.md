<!-- considerations when choosing among similar solutions -->

## What to consider when choosing among similar solutions?
## Ease of use

- does it require dedicated software?
- does it require specific training?
- can you move easily across platforms, devices?

### Who are your users?

## Who controls content

### is it stored...

- ...locally for individuals?
- ...on a (trusted) shared server?
- ...on a commercial platform?

## Performance

- Are there size limits?
- Are there speed bottlenecks?
- Is reliability high enough?

## Other considerations...

- Open source or proprietary
- Portability
- Killer features

Note: Mendeley is more restrictive in regards to the number of members in a group and the number of groups you can create. Here is a good side by side comparison: http://www.library.yorku.ca/web/research-learn/citations/zotero-vs-mendeley-comparison/
