Computational & collaboration skills for integrative conservation science workshop
=====

This intensive 4-day workshop on *Computational and Collaboration Skills for Integrative Conservation Science* held at NCEAS from June 27th to 30th aims to help participants to:

* Integrate collaborative science best practices within SNAPP Working Groups
* Empower participants to adopt computing best practices in their scientific workflows and data management
* Create a greater sense of SNAPP community identity among the postdocs
* Foster potential collaboration and enhanced knowledge-sharing across SNAPP Working Groups
* Familiarize and instruct researchers in the use of NCEAS (and other) cyberinfrastructures and services
* Clarify and reinforce commitment to open science
